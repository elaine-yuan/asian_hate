Always Alien: An Analysis of Anti-Asian Hate Crimes

Last year, I was concerned for my family. In New York City, they are not only at risk for catching COVID, but also in danger from anti-Asian hate crimes. The news articles about Asian hate crimes only added to my worry. Even if these stories are no longer in the news cycle, they are still continuing to this day. Hence, in my capstone project, I wanted to analyze hate crime datasets to understand and protect Asian communities from Asian hate crimes. 

My questions for the analysis include:
1. How does the growth of Asian hate crimes in New York City compare with the national growth?
2. Where are Asian hate crimes happening in the city? Why do they happen there?
3. How can we protect ourselves from hate crimes?

After data analysis using SQL and Tableau, I presented my findings in PowerPoint: 
1. Between 2019 to 2020, there was a 74% increase of anti-Asian hate crimes nationally and 2700% increase in New York City.
2. Queens is the safest borough for an Asian with a rate of 4 incidents per 100,000 Asians versus 41 incidents per 100,000 Asians in Manhattan.
3. In New York City, most Asian hate crimes are in Midtown, the most accessible and therefore, densely packed neighborhood.
